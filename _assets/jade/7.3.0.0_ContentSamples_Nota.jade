                            p The link between mental health and nutrition is an often overlooked one. Good nutrition can reduce the risks of developing a depressive disorder.
 
                            p Studies have found that people who eat a diet of whole foods – fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and high-quality proteins – show a reduced risk of developing some types of mental health problems. Consuming foods high in selenium, calcium, and magnesium can help with memory and stress relief, while folic acid and other B vitamins can relieve depression and fatigue.
 
                            p The Total 10 Rapid Weight-Loss Plan should have you feeling healthier than you did two weeks ago. Follow this maintenance plan to keep the momentum going and the weight off.

                            p Since your body has been without these foods for the past couple of weeks, it might have a reaction to them when they’re reintroduced into your diet. Start by testing each food with a half-cup serving to minimize the effect of any potential reactions.
 
                            p: strong *Rule #2: Avoid Packaged Snack Foodst
                            p These types of snacks will pack on the pounds, so eat protein-based snacks such as hummus and veggies, hard-boiled eggs, turkey roll-ups and chickpeas instead. You should especially avoid sugary and diet snacks with artificial sweeteners.
 
                            p: strong *Rule #3: Weigh Yourself Every Morningt
                            p People that weigh in every day have more long-term success. Look at the scale as your ally. Whether the number goes up or down, it can help you figure out what isn’t working and what you can get away with. Remember, the scale isn’t about getting a grade; it’s motivation to make progress.
 
                            p: strong *Rule #4: Allow a Splurge Once a Week
                            p Don’t strive for perfection in your diet, because perfection leads to failure. So indulge in a dessert, an entrée you’ve been craving or a glass of wine once a week.
